**NS CNC Elara CNC Mill**


# Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo has a lot of information that I have used or built to make the Elara CNC Mill perform well both as a watchmakers CNC mill and a general purpose small CNC mill.


# Getting Started	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I suggest that you start with the [quick start guides](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/quick%20start%20guides) to familiarize yourself with the functionality of the Elara CNC Mill.

Next, use the files and follow the procedures in [this folder](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/tests/first%20startup%20test) to test your mill upon your first start up.  This will verify that your mill was not damaged during shipping and that you understand the very basics of machining with the Elara.  Then, try the other tests contained in [this folder](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/tests).

If you are using Fusion360 to design your projects, you will need the CAM post processor in [this folder](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/Fusion360%20post%20processor) installed in the  Fusion360 folder on your computer.

The [Mach4](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/Mach4) and [HiCON](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/HiCON) folders in this repo contain the latest software, firmware, Lua scripts, and Mach4 profile files that have been tested and verified to work on the Elara.

The other folders in this repo are for documentation, e.g., the [spindle](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/spindle) and [touch probe](https://github.com/pfroysdon/nscnc/tree/main/touch%20probe/Metrol).
